## The makeCacheMatrix function serves the purpose of creating a special "matrix" object that is capable of
## caching its inverse. This is a crucial step in optimizing the process of matrix inversion, especially when dealing
## with large matrices or when the inversion operation needs to be performed multiple times.

## functions do
## These two functions are used to create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse and retrieve the inverse either from the cache or by calculating it if the cache is empty.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL  # Initialize the cached inverse matrix to NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y  # Set a new matrix
    m <<- NULL  # Clear the cache
  }
  get <- function() x  # Get the matrix
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse  # Set the inverse matrix
  getinverse <- function() m  # Get the inverse matrix
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)  # Return a list containing all the functions
}

## The cacheSolve function is designed to compute the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by the
## makeCacheMatrix function. It first checks if the inverse has already been calculated and cached. If so, it
## retrieves the inverse from the cache; otherwise, it calculates the inverse and caches it for future use.

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()  # Try to get the cached inverse matrix
  if (!is.null(m)) {  # If the cache is not empty
    message("getting cached data")  # Display a message indicating the use of cached data
    return(m)  # Return the cached inverse matrix
  }
  data <- x$get()  # Get the matrix
  m <- solve(data, ...)  # Calculate the inverse matrix
  x$setinverse(m)  # Cache the inverse matrix
  m  # Return the inverse matrix
}
